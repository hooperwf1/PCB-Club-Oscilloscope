# Branching

Each subsystem will have a main feature branch. Make sure to keep your design in a separate folder and a separate branch, so merging will not over write it.

For your main subsystem branch, create a branch for each feature you create, then merge and delete the branch. You don't have to for starters.

We will use Kicad 9 design blocks, with each subsystem design with multiple design blocks ready to include. I have not research enough to figure out how we can include them together.

The main board and schematic design will be on the main branch, and someone will do system integration of all the separate designs.
